# 💡 CSS Battle Arena  
🚀 *Code Your Way to Pixel Perfection!*  
**CSS Battle Arena** is a competitive, web-based coding game developed using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, created for events where players try to **recreate a given target image using only CSS**. After submission, a **Python script** compares each player's result image with the target and calculates the **percentage similarity** — the **higher the match, the better the score**!
